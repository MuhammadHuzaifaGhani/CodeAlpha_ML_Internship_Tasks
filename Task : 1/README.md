💳 Credit Scoring Prediction App

This project was developed as Task 1: Credit Scoring Model during my Machine Learning Internship at CodeAlpha.
It predicts an individual’s creditworthiness using financial history and applies multiple ML algorithms for comparison.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that classify whether an applicant is Creditworthy or Not Creditworthy.
To make it more practical, I created my own dataset and deployed the models in a Streamlit web app.

🔗 Dataset: Credit Scoring Dataset on Kaggle

⚙️ Features

Built models using:

Logistic Regression 📊

Decision Tree 🌳

Random Forest 🌲

Engineered financial features:

Debt-to-Income Ratio

Loan-to-Income Ratio

High-Debt & High-Loan Flags

Evaluated with ML metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

Interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions

Side-by-side comparison of all three models

🛠 Tech Stack
